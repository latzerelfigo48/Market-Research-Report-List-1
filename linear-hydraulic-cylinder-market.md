<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Hydraulic Cylinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Acting</li><li>Single Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The linear hydraulic cylinder market includes two primary types: double acting and single acting cylinders. Double acting cylinders use hydraulic fluid to move the piston in both directions, providing greater force and control for applications like presses and machinery. In contrast, single acting cylinders operate by using hydraulic pressure to extend the piston while a spring or gravity returns it to its original position, making them suitable for simpler tasks where retraction force is not critical or can be provided mechanically.</p></p>
